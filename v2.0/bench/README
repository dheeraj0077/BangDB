This is benchmark for bangdb. It has enough base code to run benchmark to test the BangDB performance
and at the same time tune the config param for your case. 
You may modify the code, add/edit as you like to run benchmark in different ways.

Please note, you will need to copy the libraries of the respective platform into the
lib folders to be able to run properly. For ex; if you are running it on centos7, then
please take the centos7 libs for running the benchmark
