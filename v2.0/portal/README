This is beta version of portal/dashboard for bangdb stream processing. 
You will be able to interact with bangdb for stream processing using this as well.
Further charts, reports etc. could be set up as well for the use cases.


Please note, you will need to copy the libraries of the respective platform into the
lib folders to be able to run properly. For ex; if you are running it on centos7, then
please take the centos7 libs for running the benchmark

libraries that need to be copied are;

libbangdb-client.so.2.0
libbangdb-client-java.so.2.0

You need to copy it under the lib folder

Please also see the portal(how to) doc present in the root folder
