Run
---

There are two ways to run the server;

Option1:
========

directly using the bangdb-server-2.0 binary. Here you may use command line options available that can be used

cd bin
./bangdb-server-2.0

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Command line arguments
	----------------------

	There are however several ways to configure for the server through command line arguments, 
	here are the relevant details;

	pls type help to see the options
	./bangdb-server-2.0 -help

	Here are some of the details;

	----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Usage: -i [master | slave] -r [yes | no] -t [yes | no] -d [dbname] -s [IP:PORT] -m [IP:PORT] -p [IP] -b [yes | no] -c [tcp | http | hybrid] -w [PORT] -v
	----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Options
	-------
	 -i: defines the server's identity [master | slave], default is SERVER_TYPE (master) as defined in bangdb.config
	 -r: defines replication state [yes | no], default is ENABLE_REPLICATION (0) as defined in bangdb.config 
	 -t: defines if transaction is enabled(yes) or disabled(no) [yes | no], default is no 
	 -d: defines the dbname, default is BANGDB_DATABASE_NAME (mydb) as defined in bangdb.config 
	 -s: defines IP:Port of this server, default is SERVER_ID:SERV_PORT as defined in bangdb.config
	 -m: defines IP:Port of the master (required only for slave as it declares master with this option)
	 -p: defines public IP of the server (required for master and slave to expose their own public IP)
	 -b: defines if server to be run in background as daemon, default is foreground
	 -c: defines if server runs as tcp server or http (rest) server or both (hybrid), default is tcp server
	 -w: defines the http port when server runs in http or hybrid mode     default is MASTER_SERVER_ID:MASTER_SERV_PORT as defined in the bangdb.config
	 -v: prints the alpha-numeric version of the executable

	 Hence to run master with other values as defined in the bangdb.config, issue following command
	 ./bangdb-server -s 192.168.1.5:10101

	 To run slave for this master with default other values..
	 ./bangdb-server -i slave -s 192.168.1.6:10102 -m 192.168.1.5:10101
	etc...
	----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note: you may set these from command line or you may simply set the bangdb.config for these params
Pls see the getting started section on bangdb.com/developer

Option2:
========

Or you may use the helper script "bangdb-server" present in the main folder.
This allows us to start, stop and check status using the script. It always runs the
server in the background.
To set command line options, you will need to edit the config file present in bin/ folder and set these
params accordingly. Check the bangdb.com/bangdb-config to learn more.
To run the server;

./bangdb-server start

you may check status as
./bangdb-server status

and stop it as
./bangdb-server stop

Next:

	tail the log (data/mydb.applog) to view the logs

Test
====
	> Go ahead and run the bench in the bench folder, go through the readme and run the bench
	> Go to cli and interact with the server

You may also take client (cpp or java) and run the sample app available in it
Also - ps visit bangdb.com/developer to learn more about building applications


* bangdb.config - using this you can set various run time config for the db. Also it provides
enough hadles with tune the core and internals of db to run in the best possible manner depending upon
the host configuration and boundaries. The config file has details before each of these paramaeters and also
structured in a manner to allow you to pick and modify things in rather confortable way

Please refer www.bangdb.com/developer section to get most of the detail info as needed
