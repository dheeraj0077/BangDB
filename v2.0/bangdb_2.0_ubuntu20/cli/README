There are ssl and non-ssl exe for cli, as per bangdb convention,
ssl version of binary or exe is appeneded with "_s", therefore;
ssl version     : bangdb-cli_s-2.0
non-ssl version : bangdb-cli-2.0 

cli mandates bangdb.config to be placed in the same dir as cli,
although user should not require at all to change anything in 
the bangdb.config but still it is needed as of now
---------------------------------------------------------------

cli could run simply by using following command

>./bangdb-cli-2.0

to print help

bangdb> help

or to get help for db
bangdb> help db

or to get help for stream
bangdb> help stream

and so on ...
