This is simple bench file to test the bangdb.

This may also be helpful in understanding how one can code for the BangDB, although
it covers only small part

Please go to www.bangdb.com\developer to get more info on BangDB and help
related to development of app using BangDB

Here are the steps to run the bench

First, let's build the bench

> bash build.sh

// if successful, now you may run tests

> bash exapp.sh

or, to put 1M key and val using 4 threads

> bash exapp 4 1000000 put

or, to get 1M key and val using 4 threads

> bash exapp 4 1000000 get

Note: you may have to set path to run, unless you have libs in standard folders
export  LD_LIBRARY_PATH=../lib


for bench, Various options are;

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
usage: bangdb_bench <kv/doc/stream> <num_threads> <num_items> <put/get/scan/all/overlap> [factor(optional define only with overlap)]
       factor > 1; the factor defines how much read and write
       1/factor part write and rest read. ex; factor = 3, 33 percent write and 67 percent read
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Running the default test with 4 threads (connections), put and get 500000 items


etc...
