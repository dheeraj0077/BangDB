Thanks for downloading BangDB Server!

What does it include
--------------------

1. server
2. other files [ config, libs, headers etc. ]

It's really easy to get started with server and clients

Install and run
---------------

Create a base folder/dir, untar the download file there.
BangDB requires bangdb.config file as an input, you may leave it in the same folder as bangdb-server, default bin folder


libs
====

The binary links with several libraries, few of these are provided along with the server in the lib folder.
However, please ensure you have following libs on the server (most of these might already be there or 
simply get from appropriate repo(apt, yum etc.)

First install "build-essential" (ubuntu) or "Development Tools" on centos 
sudo apt-get install build-essential [ ubuntu]
sudo yum groupinstall 'Development Tools' [ centos ]

Second, ensure that you have installed java8, python3

Then it needs certain other libs to be installed
ssl, crypto, curl, rt, dl, X11, pthread, lapack, blas, python3 
Note: for python, pls pick the right binary based on which version you would like to link with 3.5, 3.6, 3.8 so on..

Finally it also needs lib mitie, dlib which is present in the download folder (lib)

Note: 	If you wish, you may run install.sh to get the various libs and headers installed in /usr/local lib 
and include folders

libjvm
======

create a soft link to libjvm if not already there, so that server can find it easily, else export/set path to it
for ex;
sudo ln -sf $JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/amd64/server/libjvm.so /usr/local/lib/libjvm.so
OR
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/amd64/server/


That's it. You are ready to run the server.

Run
---

There are two ways to run the server;

Option1:
========

directly using the bangdb-server-2.0 binary. Here you may use command line options available that can be used

cd bin
./bangdb-server-2.0

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Configurtaion
	-------------

	There are however several ways to configure for the server, here are the relevant details;

	* configure how server should be run [ master, slave, isolated, foreground, background etc ... ]
	pls type help to see the options
	./bangdb-server-2.0 -help

	Here are some of the details;

	----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Usage: -i [master | slave] -r [yes | no] -t [yes | no] -d [dbname] -s [IP:PORT] -m [IP:PORT] -b [yes | no] -v
	----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Options
	-------
	 -i: defines the server's identity [master | slave], default is SERVER_TYPE as defined in bangdb.config
	 -r: defines replication state [yes | no], default is ENABLE_REPLICATION as defined in bangdb.config 
	 -t: defines if transaction is enabled(yes) or disabled(no) [yes | no], default is no 
	 -d: defines the dbname, default is BANGDB_DATABASE_NAME as defined in bangdb.config 
	 -s: defines IP:Port of this server, default is SERVER_ID:SERV_PORT as defined in bangdb.config
	 -m: defines IP:Port of the master (required only for slave as it declares master with this option)
	 -b: defines if server to be run in background as daemon
	     default is MASTER_SERVER_ID:MASTER_SERV_PORT as defined in the bangdb.config
	 -v: prints the alpha-numeric version of the executable

	 Hence to run master with other values as defined in the bangdb.config, issue following command
	 ./bangdb-server -s 192.168.1.5:7887

	 To run slave for this master with default other values..
	 ./bangdb-server -i slave -s 192.168.1.6:7887 -m 192.168.1.5:7887
	etc...
	----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note: you may set these from command line or you may simply set the bangdb.config for these params
Pls see the getting started section on bangdb.com/developer

Option2:
========

Or you may use the helper script "bangdb-server" present in the main folder.
This allows us to start, stop and check status using the script. It always runs the
server in the background.
To set command line options, you will need to edit the config file present in bin/ folder and set these
params accordingly. Check the bangdb.com/bangdb-config to learn more.
To run the server;

./bangdb-server start

you may check status as
./bangdb-server status

and stop it as
./bangdb-server stop

Next:
	> Go ahead and run the bench in the bench folder, go through the readme and run the bench
	> Go to cli and interact with the server

You may also take client (cpp or java) and run the sample app available in it
Also - ps visit bangdb.com/developer to learn more about building applications


* bangdb.config - using this you can set various run time config for the db. Also it provides
enough hadles with tune the core and internals of db to run in the best possible manner depending upon
the host configuration and boundaries. The config file has details before each of these paramaeters and also
structured in a manner to allow you to pick and modify things in rather confortable way

Please refer www.bangdb.com/developer section to get most of the detail info as needed
Please feel free to write to me at sachin@bangdb.com for any info, clarity, feedback etc.

We are working hard to provide more help and information on our website and also for next 3 months,
we will be releasing and updating BangDB on weekly basis. To update with new version, you won't need 
to do much except,
1. stop the db
2. copy new bangdb-server binary (only one file)
3. re run the db


Hope you find the db useful and it helps you solve some of the problems for you.
Looking forward to connect with you soon
Enjoy!
