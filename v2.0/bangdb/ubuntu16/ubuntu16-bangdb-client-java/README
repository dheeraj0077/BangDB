You may write your applications using the client.
Please see getting started with client at bangdb.com/developer

However you may simply get started by building the sample app provided here

Following steps would help;

A. link with the bangdb-client-java lib only
B. include the jar file present in the lib folder

that's it!
You may use following to build sample.cpp and run [ pls do start server before running it ]

compile...
	javac -cp .:lib/bangdb-client-java.jar:lib/json-20190722.jar test/Main.java test/Sample.java

run...
	java -cp .:lib/bangdb-client-java.jar:lib/json-20190722.jar -Djava.library.path="lib"  test.Main

Note: bangdb.config is required to run any app (keep in the same folder as exe)

Use the detail API and dev section at the bangdb.com

Enjoy!
