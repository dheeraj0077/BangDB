To run the redis bench program do following;

If you wish to build the redis (may be good option if you are running for the first time), run following;

> bash build-redis.sh

this builds redis server and the client

then build the bench files

> bash build-bench.sh

finally run the bench for redis. It requires two steps;
A. run the server, and
B. run the bench

A. go to redis/src and run the server

> ./redis-server

B. Open a new terminal, cd to the directory and simply run

> bash runapp.sh

or you may add command line args as well like this
bash runapp.sh <num_threads> <num_items> <put/get/all>

for ex; to run the bench for putting 1M key value using 100 (clients) threads, do

> bash runapp.sh 100 1000000 put

to get

> bash runapp.sh 100 1000000 get

etc...
